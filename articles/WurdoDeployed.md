# News!
I'm actually super excited as write this at 4:38 AM on a Thursday morning with spongebob floating on my computer screen!!! I can finally say that Wurdo is now live on Vercel! After months of hard work and a few all nighters, We have something to show the world. Wurdo is a word game unlike any other. Using machine learning we created a system that 
can generate infinite unique words in a word ladder puzzle. It includes a scoring system
based on the difficulty of the word and the rarity of the word. You can score using an anagram, 
changing one letter of the previous word
or rhyming with the previous word. 

# My Role
My main role on this project was backend development. I was responsible for creating the backend API for the game, that communicates with the frontend, real-time updated database, and a machine learning model that generates words and is constantly learning new words and their relationships with other words. I did not create the frontend, but I did help with the context managment for state variables as well as helping with API calls and ideas for the frontend. It was alot of all around work from my end because we were a team of 4, and my work depended on both the machine learning model and the frontend. As you can imagine, this was a challenge but it was a fun one.


If you like word games, then welcome to your new addiction.
